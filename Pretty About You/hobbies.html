<p>
I have recently been getting back into VR gaming after buying a Valve Index headset. <br>
Mainly only playing games like Beat Saber, but I will occasionally play something with a multiplayer aspect like VR Table Tennis. <br>
It's been good exercise so far, and that helps a lot since I spend most of my day sitting down at a desk. <br>
Picture unrelated.
